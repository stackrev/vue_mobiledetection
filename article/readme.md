Capacitor - a cross-platform app framework that operates on native runtime to build apps that can run natively on iOS and Android, these are also known as **Web Native Apps**.

Why use this modern native container approach? Because we want to build web-first without sacrificing access to native device SDKs, free from the complexity and nuances of various devices.

## Build your Web App

We start by spinning a simple Vue application using vue cli, and choose the default preset (babel + eslint):

`vue create app`

In the components folder, we add a new component that will detect if we are running in a mobile device or not:

```jsx
/**
 * This app provides information of the browser's host.
 */
export default {
  name: "IsThisMobile",
  data() {
    return {
      userAgent: "",
      vendor: "",
      uaParsed: null,
      deviceInfo: "",
      batteryInfo: "",
      userToken: null,
      isMobile: false,
    };
  },
  
  mounted() {
    this.loadBrowserHostData();
  },

  methods: {

    /**
     * Loads all data with the browser and it's host.
     * @see https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js
     */
    loadBrowserHostData() {
      // 1. Simplest way to ID a mobile device.
      // window.innerWidth < 600;
      // 2. The more sophisticated way is through the user agent (UA) string
      // This string is in the form: User-Agent = product *( RWS ( product / comment ) )
      // 3. https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js will structure this info.
      // 4. Be forward-compatible, userAgentData is preferred over the UA string.
      this.userAgent = navigator?.userAgent ?? "NA";
      this.vendor = navigator?.vendor ?? "NA";
      if (this.userAgent) {
        this.uaParsed = new UAParser(navigator.userAgent);
        // { model: '', type: '', vendor: '' }
        let device = this.uaParsed?.getDevice();
        // possible devices: console, mobile, tablet, smarttv, wearable, embedded
        this.isMobile = device != null ? (device?.type === "mobile") : (window.innerWidth < 600);
      }
      if (this.isMobile) {
        this.loadDeviceData()
      }
    },

    /**
     * If this is a mobile, access device info.
     * @see https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/device#deviceinfo
     * 
     */
    loadDeviceData() {
      console.log("loadDeviceData")
      const analytics = getAnalytics();

      const getInfo = async () => {
        const info = await Device.getInfo();
        this.deviceInfo = info;
      
        logEvent(analytics, 'device_load', this.deviceInfo);

        
      };

      const getBatteryInfo = async () => {
        const info = await Device.getBatteryInfo();
        this.batteryInfo = info;

        logEvent(analytics, 'devicebattery_load',this.batteryInfo);
      };
      getInfo();
      getBatteryInfo();
    }
  },
};
```

Making use of a the User Agent (UA), available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js), we can easily parse the UA string and get any relevant information.
The UA string is a defined HTTP standard in [RFC7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3). In general it comes with this format:

`User-Agent = product *( RWS ( product / comment ) )`

Start our server with **yarn serve**, and you should view information about your host:

```bash
User Agent string: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/104.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

Browser metadata:
vendor: Google Inc.
opera: NA
Browser: { "name": "Chrome", "version": "104.0.0.0", "major": "104" }
Device: {}
Engine: { "name": "Blink", "version": "104.0.0.0" }
OS: { "name": "Windows", "version": "10" }
CPU: { "architecture": "amd64" }
```

### New UA Challenger Update!

At the time of writing, the above is still possible on Chromium browsers, but google is planning to reduce this information due to user's being fingerprinted. Check the announcement [here](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/update-on-user-agent-string-reduction.html). 

In our case, we can be forward-compatible through accessing the **navigator.userAgentData** object:

```jsx
if (navigator?.userAgentData) {
  this.userAgent = JSON.stringify(navigator.userAgentData);
  this.vendor = navigator.userAgentData.brands[0];
  this.isMobile = navigator.userAgentData.mobile;
}
else {
  // Do the legacy UA detection.
  ...
}
```        

# Fire up the Capacitors

Now the fun part. Adding [capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to the mix will allow our simple web app to be deployed on mobiles.

`vue add capacitor`

You'll be asked what is this for either *IOS* or *Android*, choose whichever you target device is. Within this article, we will only use the android setup.

Or use the more modern Capacitor CLI (you need to choose between IOS and Android):

```bash
npm init @capacitor/app
yarn add @capacitor/core
yarn add @capacitor/cli
npx cap init

npx cap add android | ios
```

Build your webapp, then sync it to capacitor and have it run in your favorite android IDE:

`yarn capacitor:build --android && npx cap run android` 

Or using the capacitor cli:

```bash
yarn build
npx cap sync
```

Note that both these commands also do a `npx cap sync` (the vue cli does it implicitly), which syncs the web code and plugins with the native project.

## Setup for Device Specifics

Depending on what flavor of device you are running, you might run into these additional configurations.

### SDKs and Licences

 You would need to accept and download specific tools, SDKs and licences for both Xcode or Android Studio. Follow their relevant instructions.

For android, we opened our Android studio and went to tools->SDK Manager. There we installed the APIs required and the android SDK we will build against:

![Image: Android Studio SDK](androidStudioSDK.PNG "Android Studio SDK")

### Device Developer Mode

To run on your device, you will need to enable developer options and USB wire debugging. 

This is different for every model, the one used here - a galaxy 10 - required us to tap 7 times on its build number before developer options were enabled in the device setting.

![Image: Samsung Developer Options](devOptionsSamsung.jpg "Samsung Developer Options")

# Run your App

Once you resolve any needs required by your device, build your device bundles (e.g. APK for Android) and run the app from your device IDE (Xcode or Android studio) while wired to your mobile:

![Image: Samsung App](appFromSamsung.jpg "Samsung App")

If the at any point the installation fails, you need to uninstall the previous app from your device.

## Leverage Capacitor APIs

Having metadata on the host's browser is good, but we want to directly access the device. 
Let's use the APIs exposed by capacitor to know about the hardware hosting the browser.

First we install the capacitor device library and sync with the device bundle we created.

```bash
yarn add @capacitor/device
npx cap sync
```

If at any time you get errors building or running your app, check the versions installed by capacitor. 
All major versions should be the same (Vue cli could have installed older versions). At the time of writing, these versions are:

```json
"@capacitor/android": "^4.1.0",
"@capacitor/cli": "^4.1.0",
"@capacitor/core": "^4.1.0",
"@capacitor/device": "^4.0.1",
```

With that done, we can see information about our hardware, in this case this is what samsung shows:

# Firebase it - More Power

Firebase is Google's app development framework, and provides usefule services for all your apps released to the world. These services include serverless functions, noSQL databases, hosting, analytics and other goodies that you would use to connect your users.

For our simple mobile detector app, we will authenticate the user and use the noSQL database to save any details we read from the device. 


## Add the Firebase SDK

Add firebase to our webapp, note that there is a mobile version of the SDK - but we won't use this, because capacitor is web app first:

`yarn add firebase`

Go to the firebase site and create a new project. Generate the projects configs and copy them to a seperate plugins file in our web app project:

```javascript
import { initializeApp, getApp, getApps } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";

class Firebase {
  constructor(configOptions) {
    this.configOptions = configOptions || {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyDxc66sS4nLWNQl5i6CZxQtgxAPSEO8KKs",
      authDomain: "mobiledetector-f886a.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "mobiledetector-f886a",
      storageBucket: "mobiledetector-f886a.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "1095716578462",
      appId: "1:1095716578462:web:08ffd8e1e345e9c056478f",
      measurementId: "G-GH6Z5G0RGC",
    };
    this.app = null;
    this.analytics = null;
  }

  initialize() {
    if (!getApps || !getApps() || !getApps().length) {
      this.app = initializeApp(this.configOptions);
    } else {
      this.app = getApp();
    }
    this.analytics = getAnalytics(this.app);
  }
}

const firebase = new Firebase();
export default firebase;
```

and initialize it from our **main.vue**:

```javascript
import firebase from "./firebase";

firebase.initialize();
```
## Authenticate with Google

A good rule of thumb to prevent abuse of your resources is to authenticate all who will use your cloud services. In this case, using the ready made google authentation flow to identify our users.

Authentication is either native or web, with capacitor we have a web plugin that will bridge the gap, this being @capacitor-firebase/authentication:

```bash
npm install @capacitor-firebase/authentication
npx cap sync
```

In **capacitor.config.json** add the plugin config:
```json
"plugins": {
  "FirebaseAuthentication": {
    "skipNativeAuth": false,
    "providers": [ "google.com"]
  }
}
```

The first time the page loads, we will ask the user to login using the mount hook from vuejs:

```jsx
const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
  const result = await FirebaseAuthentication.signInWithGoogle();
  return result.user;
};
```

This is enough for a webapp, but we want the same functionality to be available on our device. 
Run the *yarn capacitor:build* command and go to the android folder and find the file **variables.gradle**. Within this file add the following setting:

```gradle
ext {
    ...
    rgcfaIncludeGoogle = true
}
```
Sync your device project again with *npx cap sync*.

To connect to firebase and the authentication service, we need a sign-in certificate, create it with your keytool and check its content:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore $HOME\\.android\\debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore $HOME\\.android\\debug.keystore -keypass android
```

you should see the following output (scrambled in this article for security):
```bash
Alias name: androiddebugkey
Creation date: Jan 9, 2022
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:
Owner: C=US, O=Android, CN=Android Debug
Issuer: C=US, O=Android, CN=Android Debug
Serial number: 1
Valid from: Sun Jan 09 01:15:04 CET 2022 until: Tue Jan 02 01:15:04 CET 2052
Certificate fingerprints:
         SHA1: XX:XX:XX:XX:F5:7C:D5:XX:XX:EB:B8:XX:4B:78:XX:XX:XX:A2:XX:XX
         SHA256: XX:XX:XX:4A:XX:6F:XX:27:51:11:90:7A:XX:XX:XX:XX:E7:XX:XX:XX:DC:XX:E3:XX:XX:XX:64:F7:36:XX:XX:XX
Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA (weak)
Subject Public Key Algorithm: 2048-bit RSA key
Version: 1

Warning:
The certificate uses the SHA1withRSA signature algorithm which is considered a security risk. This algorithm will be disabled in a future update.
```
This google-specific debug certificate should always have the following settings:
- Keystore name: "debug.keystore"
- Keystore password: "android"
- Key alias: "androiddebugkey"
- Key password: "android"
- CN: "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"

Add the fingerprints to the Firebase projects settings:

![Image: Firebase Fingerprints](fingerprintOnFirebase.PNG "Firebase Fingerprints")

Run *npx cap run android* or use your android IDE, and you should see this on your device:

## Databases for your Data Needs

Now that we can identify the user, we can save data for them - or us. Let's add the firebase database service to our mobile app.

`yarn add firebase/database`

We will access the database with the following apis:

```javascript
import {
  getDatabase,
  ref,
  child,
  set,
  get,
  push,
  query,
  limitToLast,
  orderByChild,
} from "firebase/database";
import moment from "moment";

class DatabaseService {
  constructor() {
    this.db = null;
  }

  initialize() {
    this.db = getDatabase();
    this.dbrefMobiles = ref(this.db, "mobiles");
    this.dbrefBrowsers = ref(this.db, "browsers");
  }

  saveMobile(uid, mobile) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const obj = {};
      obj[`${uid}`] = mobile;
      set(this.dbrefMobiles, obj)
        .then(() => {
          resolve(obj);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          reject(null, error);
        });
    });
  }

  saveBrowser(uid, userAgent) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const obj = {};
      obj[`${uid}`] = userAgent;
      set(this.dbrefBrowsers, obj)
        .then(() => {
          resolve(obj);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          reject(null, error);
        });
    });
  }
}

const databaseService = new DatabaseService();
export default databaseService;

```

We call *saveMobile* to store the metadata of the device indexed by the **user id**. Browse to your firebase account and have a look at the realtime database, you ought to see some data:

![Image: Firebase DB](dbFirebase.PNG "Firebase DB")

But, leaving the database with defaults settings is risky - as all who can call that database can access everyone's data. This is because currently the database rules are set as follows:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```
This means all reads and writes on all paths and documents are allowed.

Let's secure it to only logged in users. Firebase comes with an environment variable called *$uid* which we can use in these settings, to limit users to only their own data:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid",
      }
    }
  }
}
```
*"auth != null"* tells our database that only logged in users can do actions to the database, while *"$uid === auth.uid"* hints that a user can only affect a path under their user id number.

In the same tab where you set these access rules, you have a sandbox to test these access rights:

![Image: Firebase DB with access](dbWithAuth.PNG "Firebase DB with access")

With all this set, if we run our capacitor again and login from the mobile device, our database should be populated as follows:

![Image: Firebase DB with All](dbWithMobile.PNG "Firebase DB with All")

# Conclusion

In this article, we discovered the portable magic of using capacitor with your work to provide an App on both browsers and mobile devices.

We understood how to detect what is running the browser and how to access its specs.

Finally we got acquinted with firebase, the best platfrom for all device and web apps out there. With such technology, there are no more complexities or nuances for every device - making a mobile and web app is no brainer.

Enjoy your rise up those app stores' rankings!
